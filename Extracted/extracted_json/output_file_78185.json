These high-\nperforming vision transformers are pre-trained with hundreds of millions\nof images using a large infrastructure, thereby limiting their adoption.\nIn this work, we produce competitive convolution-free transformers by\ntraining on Imagenet only. We train them on a single computer in less than\n3 days. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1\naccuracy of 83.1% (single-crop) on ImageNet with no external data.\nMore importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy speciﬁc to\ntransformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student\nlearns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this\ntoken-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This\nleads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet\n(where we obtain up to 85.2% accuracy) and when transferring to other\ntasks. We share our code and models.\n1 Introduction\nConvolutional neural networks have been the main design paradigm for image\nunderstanding tasks, as initially demonstrated on image classiﬁcation tasks.\nOne of the ingredient to their success was the availability of a large training set,\nnamely Imagenet [13, 42]. Motivated by the success of attention-based mod-\nels in Natural Language Processing [14, 52], there has been increasing interest\nin architectures leveraging attention mechanisms within convnets [2, 34, 61].\nMore recently several researchers have proposed hybrid architecture trans-\nplanting transformer ingredients to convnets to solve vision tasks [6, 43].\nThe vision transformer (ViT) introduced by Dosovitskiy et al. [15] is an ar-\nchitecture directly inherited from Natural Language Processing [52], but ap-\n1\narXiv:2012.12877v2  [cs.CV]  15 Jan 2021⚗↑\n⚗\n⚗\n⚗\nFigure 1: Throughput and accuracy on Imagenet of our methods compared to\nEfﬁcientNets, trained on Imagenet1k only.

Their paper pre-\nsented excellent results with transformers trained with a large private labelled\nimage dataset (JFT-300M [46], 300 millions images). The paper concluded that\ntransformers “do not generalize well when trained on insufﬁcient amounts of data” ,\nand the training of these models involved extensive computing resources.\nIn this paper, we train a vision transformer on a single 8-GPU node in two\nto three days (53 hours of pre-training, and optionally 20 hours of ﬁne-tuning)\nthat is competitive with convnets having a similar number of parameters and\nefﬁciency. It uses Imagenet as the sole training set. We build upon the vi-\nsual transformer architecture from Dosovitskiy et al. [15] and improvements\nincluded in the timm library [55]. With our Data-efﬁcient image Transformers\n(DeiT), we report large improvements over previous results, see Figure 1. Our\nablation study details the hyper-parameters and key ingredients for a success-\nful training, such as repeated augmentation.\nWe address another question: how to distill these models? We introduce\na token-based strategy, speciﬁc to transformers and denoted by DeiT\n⚗ , and\nshow that it advantageously replaces the usual distillation.\n2In summary, our work makes the following contributions:\n• We show that our neural networks that contains no convolutional layer\ncan achieve competitive results against the state of the art on ImageNet\nwith no external data. They are learned on a single node with 4 GPUs in\nthree days1. Our two new models DeiT-S and DeiT-Ti have fewer param-\neters and can be seen as the counterpart of ResNet-50 and ResNet-18.\n• We introduce a new distillation procedure based on a distillation token,\nwhich plays the same role as the class token, except that it aims at re-\nproducing the label estimated by the teacher. Both tokens interact in the\ntransformer through attention. This transformer-speciﬁc strategy outper-\nforms vanilla distillation by a signiﬁcant margin.\n• Interestingly, with our distillation, image transformers learn more from a\nconvnet than from another transformer with comparable performance.\n• Our models pre-learned on Imagenet are competitive when transferred to\ndifferent downstream tasks such as ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation, on several\npopular public benchmarks: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Oxford-102 ﬂowers,\nStanford Cars and iNaturalist-18/19.\nThis paper is organized as follows: we review related works in Section 2,\nand focus on transformers for image classiﬁcation in Section 3. We introduce\nour distillation strategy for transformers in Section 4. The experimental sec-\ntion 5 provides analysis and comparisons against both convnets and recent\ntransformers, as well as a comparative evaluation of our transformer-speciﬁc\ndistillation. Section 6 details our training scheme. It includes an extensive ab-\nlation of our data-efﬁcient training choices, which gives some insight on the\nkey ingredients involved in DeiT. We conclude in Section 7.\n2 Related work\nImage Classiﬁcation is so core to computer vision that it is often used as a\nbenchmark to measure progress in image understanding. Any progress usu-\nally translates to improvement in other related tasks such as detection or seg-\nmentation. Since 2012’s AlexNet [32], convnets have dominated this bench-\nmark and have become the de facto standard. The evolution of the state of the\nart on the ImageNet dataset [42] reﬂects the progress with convolutional neural\nnetwork architectures and learning [32, 44, 48, 50, 51, 57].\nDespite several attempts to use transformers for image classiﬁcation [7], un-\ntil now their performance has been inferior to that of convnets. Nevertheless\nhybrid architectures that combine convnets and transformers, including the\nself-attention mechanism, have recently exhibited competitive results in image\nclassiﬁcation [56], detection [6, 28], video processing [45, 53], unsupervised ob-\nject discovery [35], and uniﬁed text-vision tasks [8, 33, 37].\n1We can accelerate the learning of the larger model DeiT-B by training it on 8 GPUs in two days.\n3Recently Vision transformers (ViT) [15] closed the gap with the state of the\nart on ImageNet, without using any convolution. This performance is remark-\nable since convnet methods for image classiﬁcation have beneﬁted from years\nof tuning and optimization [22, 55]. Nevertheless, according to this study [15],\na pre-training phase on a large volume of curated data is required for the\nlearned transformer to be effective. In our paper we achieve a strong perfor-\nmance without requiring a large training dataset, i.e., with Imagenet1k only.\nThe Transformer architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al. [52] for machine\ntranslation are currently the reference model for all natural language process-\ning (NLP) tasks. Many improvements of convnets for image classiﬁcation are\ninspired by transformers. For example, Squeeze and Excitation [2], Selective\nKernel [34] and Split-Attention Networks [61] exploit mechanism akin to trans-\nformers self-attention (SA) mechanism.\nKnowledge Distillation (KD), introduced by Hinton et al. [24], refers to the\ntraining paradigm in which a student model leverages “soft” labels coming\nfrom a strongteacher network. This is the output vector of the teacher’s softmax\nfunction rather than just the maximum of scores, wich gives a “hard” label.\nSuch a training improves the performance of the student model (alternatively,\nit can be regarded as a form of compression of the teacher model into a smaller\none – the student). On the one hand the teacher’s soft labels will have a similar\neffect to labels smoothing [58]. On the other hand as shown by Wei et al. [54]\nthe teacher’s supervision takes into account the effects of the data augmenta-\ntion, which sometimes causes a misalignment between the real label and the\nimage. For example, let us consider image with a “cat” label that represents a\nlarge landscape and a small cat in a corner. If the cat is no longer on the crop\nof the data augmentation it implicitly changes the label of the image. KD can\ntransfer inductive biases [1] in a soft way in a student model using a teacher\nmodel where they would be incorporated in a hard way. For example, it may\nbe useful to induce biases due to convolutions in a transformer model by using\na convolutional model as teacher. In our paper we study the distillation of a\ntransformer student by either a convnet or a transformer teacher. We introduce\na new distillation procedure speciﬁc to transformers and show its superiority.\n3 Vision transformer: overview\nIn this section, we brieﬂy recall preliminaries associated with the vision trans-\nformer [15, 52], and further discuss positional encoding and resolution.\nMulti-head Self Attention layers (MSA). The attention mechanism is based\non a trainable associative memory with (key, value) vector pairs. Aquery vector\nq ∈Rd is matched against a set of kkey vectors (packed together into a matrix\nK ∈Rk×d) using inner products. These inner products are then scaled and\n4normalized with a softmax function to obtain k weights. The output of the\nattention is the weighted sum of a set ofkvalue vectors (packed intoV ∈Rk×d).\nFor a sequence of N query vectors (packed into Q ∈RN×d), it produces an\noutput matrix (of size N ×d):\nAttention(Q,K,V ) = Softmax(QK⊤/\n√\nd)V, (1)\nwhere the Softmax function is applied over each row of the input matrix and\nthe\n√\ndterm provides appropriate normalization.\nIn [52], a Self-attention layer is proposed. Query, key and values matrices\nare themselves computed from a sequence of N input vectors (packed into\nX ∈RN×D): Q = XWQ, K = XWK, V = XWV, using linear transformations\nWQ,WK,WV with the constraint k = N, meaning that the attention is in be-\ntween all the input vectors.\nFinally, Multi-head self-attention layer (MSA) is deﬁned by considering hat-\ntention “heads”, ie hself-attention functions applied to the input. Each head\nprovides a sequence of size N ×d. These h sequences are rearranged into a\nN ×dhsequence that is reprojected by a linear layer into N ×D.\nTransformer block for images. To get a full transformer block as in [52], we\nadd a Feed-Forward Network (FFN) on top of the MSA layer. This FFN is\ncomposed of two linear layers separated by a GeLu activation [23]. The ﬁrst\nlinear layer expands the dimension fromDto 4D, and the second layer reduces\nthe dimension from4Dback to D. Both MSA and FFN are operating as residual\noperators thank to skip-connections, and with a layer normalization [3].\nIn order to get a transformer to process images, our work builds upon the\nViT model [15]. It is a simple and elegant architecture that processes input\nimages as if they were a sequence of input tokens. The ﬁxed-size input RGB\nimage is decomposed into a batch of N patches of a ﬁxed size of 16 ×16 pixels\n(N = 14 ×14). Each patch is projected with a linear layer that conserves its\noverall dimension 3 ×16 ×16 = 768.\nThe transformer block described above is invariant to the order of the patch\nembeddings, and thus does not consider their relative position. The positional\ninformation is incorporated as ﬁxed [52] or trainable [18] positional embed-\ndings. They are added before the ﬁrst transformer block to the patch tokens,\nwhich are then fed to the stack of transformer blocks.\nThe class token is a trainable vector, appended to the patch tokens before the\nﬁrst layer, that goes through the transformer layers, and is then projected with\na linear layer to predict the class. This class token is inherited from NLP [14],\nand departs from the typical pooling layers used in computer vision to predict\nthe class. The transformer thus process batches of (N+ 1)tokens of dimension\nD, of which only the class vector is used to predict the output. This architecture\nforces the self-attention to spread information between the patch tokens and\nthe class token: at training time the supervision signal comes only from the\nclass embedding, while the patch tokens are the model’s only variable input.\n5Fixing the positional encoding across resolutions. Touvron et al. [50] show\nthat it is desirable to use a lower training resolution and ﬁne-tune the network\nat the larger resolution. This speeds up the full training and improves the accu-\nracy under prevailing data augmentation schemes. When increasing the reso-\nlution of an input image, we keep the patch size the same, therefore the number\nN of input patches does change. Due to the architecture of transformer blocks\nand the class token, the model and classiﬁer do not need to be modiﬁed to pro-\ncess more tokens. In contrast, one needs to adapt the positional embeddings,\nbecause there are N of them, one for each patch. Dosovitskiy et al. [15] inter-\npolate the positional encoding when changing the resolution and demonstrate\nthat this method works with the subsequent ﬁne-tuning stage.\n4 Distillation through attention\nIn this section we assume we have access to a strong image classiﬁer as a\nteacher model. It could be a convnet, or a mixture of classiﬁers. We address\nthe question of how to learn a transformer by exploiting this teacher. As we\nwill see in Section 5 by comparing the trade-off between accuracy and image\nthroughput, it can be beneﬁcial to replace a convolutional neural network by\na transformer. This section covers two axes of distillation: hard distillation\nversus soft distillation, and classical distillation versus the distillation token.\nSoft distillation [24, 54] minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between\nthe softmax of the teacher and the softmax of the student model.\nLet Zt be the logits of the teacher model, Zs the logits of the student model.\nWe denote by τ the temperature for the distillation, λ the coefﬁcient balanc-\ning the Kullback–Leibler divergence loss (KL) and the cross-entropy (LCE) on\nground truth labels y, and ψthe softmax function. The distillation objective is\nLglobal = (1−λ)LCE(ψ(Zs),y) +λτ2KL(ψ(Zs/τ),ψ(Zt/τ)). (2)\nHard-label distillation. We introduce a variant of distillation where we take\nthe hard decision of the teacher as a true label. Let yt = argmaxcZt(c) be the\nhard decision of the teacher, the objective associated with this hard-label distil-\nlation is:\nLhardDistill\nglobal = 1\n2LCE(ψ(Zs),y) +1\n2LCE(ψ(Zs),yt). (3)\nFor a given image, the hard label associated with the teacher may change\ndepending on the speciﬁc data augmentation. We will see that this choice is\nbetter than the traditional one, while being parameter-free and conceptually\nsimpler: The teacher prediction yt plays the same role as the true label y.\nNote also that the hard labels can also be converted into soft labels with\nlabel smoothing [47], where the true label is considered to have a probability\nof 1 −ε, and the remaining εis shared across the remaining classes. We ﬁx this\nparameter to ε= 0.1 in our all experiments that use true labels.\n6self-attentionFFN\nclass \ntoken \ndistillation \ntoken \npatch \ntokens \nFigure 2: Our distillation procedure: we simply include a new distillation token.\nIt interacts with the class and patch tokens through the self-attention layers.\nThis distillation token is employed in a similar fashion as the class token, ex-\ncept that on output of the network its objective is to reproduce the (hard) label\npredicted by the teacher, instead of true label. Both the class and distillation\ntokens input to the transformers are learned by back-propagation.\nDistillation token. We now focus on our proposal, which is illustrated in\nFigure 2. We add a new token, the distillation token, to the initial embeddings\n(patches and class token). Our distillation token is used similarly as the class\ntoken: it interacts with other embeddings through self-attention, and is output\nby the network after the last layer. Its target objective is given by the distillation\ncomponent of the loss. The distillation embedding allows our model to learn\nfrom the output of the teacher, as in a regular distillation, while remaining\ncomplementary to the class embedding.\nInterestingly, we observe that the learned class and distillation tokens con-\nverge towards different vectors: the average cosine similarity between these\ntokens equal to 0.06. As the class and distillation embeddings are computed\nat each layer, they gradually become more similar through the network, all the\nway through the last layer at which their similarity is high (cos=0.93), but still\nlower than 1. This is expected since as they aim at producing targets that are\nsimilar but not identical.\n7We veriﬁed that our distillation token adds something to the model, com-\npared to simply adding an additional class token associated with the same tar-\nget label: instead of a teacher pseudo-label, we experimented with a trans-\nformer with two class tokens. Even if we initialize them randomly and inde-\npendently, during training they converge towards the same vector (cos=0.999),\nand the output embedding are also quasi-identical. This additional class token\ndoes not bring anything to the classiﬁcation performance. In contrast, our dis-\ntillation strategy provides a signiﬁcant improvement over a vanilla distillation\nbaseline, as validated by our experiments in Section 5.2.\nFine-tuning with distillation. We use both the true label and teacher predic-\ntion during the ﬁne-tuning stage at higher resolution. We use a teacher with the\nsame target resolution, typically obtained from the lower-resolution teacher by\nthe method of Touvron et al [50]. We have also tested with true labels only but\nthis reduces the beneﬁt of the teacher and leads to a lower performance.\nClassiﬁcation with our approach: joint classiﬁers. At test time, both the\nclass or the distillation embeddings produced by the transformer are associ-\nated with linear classiﬁers and able to infer the image label. Yet our referent\nmethod is the late fusion of these two separate heads, for which we add the\nsoftmax output by the two classiﬁers to make the prediction. We evaluate these\nthree options in Section 5.\n5 Experiments\nThis section presents a few analytical experiments and results. We ﬁrst discuss\nour distillation strategy. Then we comparatively analyze the efﬁciency and\naccuracy of convnets and vision transformers.\n5.1 Transformer models\nAs mentioned earlier, our architecture design is identical to the one proposed\nby Dosovitskiy et al. [15] with no convolutions. Our only differences are the\ntraining strategies, and the distillation token. Also we do not use a MLP head\nfor the pre-training but only a linear classiﬁer. To avoid any confusion, we refer\nto the results obtained in the prior work by ViT, and preﬁx ours by DeiT. If not\nspeciﬁed, DeiT refers to our referent model DeiT-B, which has the same archi-\ntecture as ViT-B. When we ﬁne-tune DeiT at a larger resolution, we append the\nresulting operating resolution at the end, e.g, DeiT-B ↑384. Last, when using\nour distillation procedure, we identify it with an alembic sign as DeiT\n⚗ .\nThe parameters of ViT-B (and therefore of DeiT-B) are ﬁxed as D = 768,\nh = 12and d = D/h = 64. We introduce two smaller models, namely DeiT-S\nand DeiT-Ti, for which we change the number of heads, keepingdﬁxed. Table 1\nsummarizes the models that we consider in our paper.\n8Table 1: Variants of our DeiT architecture. The larger model, DeiT-B, has the\nsame architecture as the ViT-B [15]. The only parameters that vary across mod-\nels are the embedding dimension and the number of heads, and we keep the\ndimension per head constant (equal to 64). Smaller models have a lower pa-\nrameter count, and a faster throughput. The throughput is measured for im-\nages at resolution 224×224.\nModel ViT model embedding #heads #layers #params training throughput\ndimension resolution (im/sec)\nDeiT-Ti N/A 192 3 12 5M 224 2536\nDeiT-S N/A 384 6 12 22M 224 940\nDeiT-B ViT-B 768 12 12 86M 224 292\nTable 2: We compare on ImageNet [42] the performance (top-1 acc., %) of the\nstudent as a function of the teacher model used for distillation.\nTeacher Student: DeiT-B\n⚗\nModels acc. pretrain ↑384\nDeiT-B 81.8 81.9 83.1\nRegNetY-4GF 80.0 82.7 83.6\nRegNetY-8GF 81.7 82.7 83.8\nRegNetY-12GF 82.4 83.1 84.1\nRegNetY-16GF 82.9 83.1 84.2\n5.2 Distillation\nOur distillation method produces a vision transformer that becomes on par\nwith the best convnets in terms of the trade-off between accuracy and through-\nput, see Table 5. Interestingly, the distilled model outperforms its teacher in\nterms of the trade-off between accuracy and throughput. Our best model on\nImageNet-1k is 85.2% top-1 accuracy outperforms the best Vit-B model pre-\ntrained on JFT-300M at resolution 384 (84.15%). For reference, the current state\nof the art of 88.55% achieved with extra training data was obtained by the ViT-\nH model (600M parameters) trained on JFT-300M at resolution 512. Hereafter\nwe provide several analysis and observations.\nConvnets teachers. We have observed that using a convnet teacher gives bet-\nter performance than using a transformer. Table 2 compares distillation results\nwith different teacher architectures. The fact that the convnet is a better teacher\nis probably due to the inductive bias inherited by the transformers through\ndistillation, as explained in Abnar et al. [1]. In all of our subsequent distilla-\ntion experiments the default teacher is a RegNetY-16GF [40] (84M parameters)\nthat we trained with the same data and same data-augmentation as DeiT. This\nteacher reaches 82.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.\n9Table 3: Distillation experiments on Imagenet with DeiT, 300 epochs of pre-\ntraining. We report the results for our new distillation method in the last three\nrows. We separately report the performance when classifying with only one of\nthe class or distillation embeddings, and then with a classiﬁer taking both of\nthem as input. In the last row (class+distillation), the result correspond to the\nlate fusion of the class and distillation classiﬁers.\nSupervision ImageNet top-1 (%)\nmethod↓ label teacher Ti 224 S 224 B 224 B ↑384\nDeiT– no distillation \u0013 \u0017 72.2 79.8 81.8 83.1\nDeiT– usual distillation \u0017 soft 72.2 79.8 81.8 83.2\nDeiT– hard distillation \u0017 hard 74.3 80.9 83.0 84.0\nDeiT\n⚗ : class embedding \u0013 hard 73.9 80.9 83.0 84.2\nDeiT\n⚗ : distil. embedding \u0013 hard 74.6 81.1 83.1 84.4\nDeiT\n⚗ : class+distillation \u0013 hard 74.5 81.2 83.4 84.5\nComparison of distillation methods. We compare the performance of differ-\nent distillation strategies in Table 3. Hard distillation signiﬁcantly outperforms\nsoft distillation for transformers, even when using only a class token: hard dis-\ntillation reaches 83.0% at resolution 224×224, compared to the soft distillation\naccuracy of 81.8%. Our distillation strategy from Section 4 further improves\nthe performance, showing that the two tokens provide complementary infor-\nmation useful for classiﬁcation: the classiﬁer on the two tokens is signiﬁcantly\nbetter than the independent class and distillation classiﬁers, which by them-\nselves already outperform the distillation baseline.\nThe distillation token gives slightly better results than the class token. It\nis also more correlated to the convnets prediction. This difference in perfor-\nmance is probably due to the fact that it beneﬁts more from the inductive bias\nof convnets. We give more details and an analysis in the next paragraph. The\ndistillation token has an undeniable advantage for the initial training.\nAgreement with the teacher & inductive bias? As discussed above, the ar-\nchitecture of the teacher has an important impact. Does it inherit existing in-\nductive bias that would facilitate the training? While we believe it difﬁcult to\nformally answer this question, we analyze in Table 4 the decision agreement\nbetween the convnet teacher, our image transformer DeiT learned from labels\nonly, and our transformer DeiT\n⚗ .\nOur distilled model is more correlated to the convnet than with a trans-\nformer learned from scratch. As to be expected, the classiﬁer associated with\nthe distillation embedding is closer to the convnet that the one associated with\nthe class embedding, and conversely the one associated with the class embed-\nding is more similar to DeiT learned without distillation. Unsurprisingly, the\njoint class+distil classiﬁer offers a middle ground.\n10Table 4: Disagreement analysis between convnet, image transformers and dis-\ntillated transformers: We report the fraction of sample classiﬁed differently for\nall classiﬁer pairs, i.e., the rate of different decisions. We include two models\nwithout distillation (a RegNetY and DeiT-B), so that we can compare how our\ndistilled models and classiﬁcation heads are correlated to these teachers.\ngroundtruth no distillation DeiT\n⚗ student (of the convnet)\nconvnet DeiT class distillation DeiT\n⚗\ngroundtruth 0.000 0.171 0.182 0.170 0.169 0.166\nconvnet (RegNetY) 0.171 0.000 0.133 0.112 0.100 0.102\nDeiT 0.182 0.133 0.000 0.109 0.110 0.107\nDeiT\n⚗ – class only 0.170 0.112 0.109 0.000 0.050 0.033\nDeiT\n⚗ – distil. only 0.169 0.100 0.110 0.050 0.000 0.019\nDeiT\n⚗ – class+distil. 0.166 0.102 0.107 0.033 0.019 0.000\nNumber of epochs. Increasing the number of epochs signiﬁcantly improves\nthe performance of training with distillation, see Figure 3. With 300 epochs,\nour distilled network DeiT-B\n⚗ is already better than DeiT-B. But while for the\nlatter the performance saturates with longer schedules, our distilled network\nclearly beneﬁts from a longer training time.\n5.3 Efﬁciency vs accuracy: a comparative study with convnets\nIn the literature, the image classiﬁcaton methods are often compared as a com-\npromise between accuracy and another criterion, such as FLOPs, number of\nparameters, size of the network, etc.\nWe focus in Figure 1 on the tradeoff between the throughput (images pro-\ncessed per second) and the top-1 classiﬁcation accuracy on ImageNet. We focus\non the popular state-of-the-art EfﬁcientNet convnet, which has beneﬁted from\nyears of research on convnets and was optimized by architecture search on the\nImageNet validation set.\nOur method DeiT is slightly below EfﬁcientNet, which shows that we have\nalmost closed the gap between vision transformers and convnets when training\nwith Imagenet only.

For distillation we follow\nthe recommendations from Cho et al. [9] to select the parameters τ and λ. We\ntake the typical values τ = 3.0 and λ= 0.1 for the usual (soft) distillation.\nData-Augmentation. Compared to models that integrate more priors (such\nas convolutions), transformers require a larger amount of data. Thus, in order\nto train with datasets of the same size, we rely on extensive data augmentation.\nWe evaluate different types of strong data augmentation, with the objective to\nreach a data-efﬁcient training regime.\nAuto-Augment [11], Rand-Augment [12], and random erasing [62] im-\nprove the results. For the two latter we use the timm [55] customizations, and\nafter ablation we choose Rand-Augment instead of AutoAugment. Overall our\nexperiments conﬁrm that transformers require a strong data augmentation: al-\nmost all the data-augmentation methods that we evaluate prove to be useful.\nOne exception is dropout, which we exclude from our training procedure.\n15Methods ViT-B [15] DeiT-B\nEpochs 300 300\nBatch size 4096 1024\nOptimizer AdamW AdamW\nlearning rate 0.003 0.0005×batchsize\n512\nLearning rate decay cosine cosine\nWeight decay 0.3 0.05\nWarmup epochs 3.4 5\nLabel smoothingε \u0017 0.1\nDropout 0.1 \u0017\nStoch.

We have considered different optimizers and\ncross-validated different learning rates and weight decays. Transformers are\nsensitive to the setting of optimization hyper-parameters. Therefore, during\ncross-validation, we tried 3 different learning rates (5.10−4,3.10−4,5.10−5) and\n3 weight decay ( 0.03, 0.04, 0.05). We scale the learning rate according to the\nbatch size with the formula: lrscaled = lr\n512 ×batchsize, similarly to Goyal et\nal. [19] except that we use 512 instead of 256 as the base value.\nThe best results use the AdamW optimizer with the same learning rates as\nViT [15] but with a much smaller weight decay, as the weight decay reported\nin the paper hurts the convergence in our setting.\nWe have employed stochastic depth [29], which facilitates the convergence\nof transformers, especially deep ones [16, 17]. For vision transformers, they\nwere ﬁrst adopted in the training procedure by Wightman [55]. Regularization\nlike Mixup [60] and Cutmix [59] improve performance. We also use repeated\naugmentation [4, 25], which provides a signiﬁcant boost in performance and is\none of the key ingredients of our proposed training procedure.\nExponential Moving Average (EMA). We evaluate the EMA of our network\nobtained after training. There are small gains, which vanish after ﬁne-tuning:\nthe EMA model has an edge of is 0.1 accuracy points, but when ﬁne-tuned the\ntwo models reach the same (improved) performance.\nFine-tuning at different resolution.

[51]).\nWe also interpolate the positional embeddings: In principle any classical image\nscaling technique, like bilinear interpolation, could be used. However, a bilin-\near interpolation of a vector from its neighbors reduces its ℓ2-norm compared\nto its neighbors. These low-norm vectors are not adapted to the pre-trained\ntransformers and we observe a signiﬁcant drop in accuracy if we employ use\ndirectly without any form of ﬁne-tuning. Therefore we adopt a bicubic interpo-\nlation that approximately preserves the norm of the vectors, before ﬁne-tuning\nthe network with either AdamW [36] or SGD. These optimizers have a similar\nperformance for the ﬁne-tuning stage, see Table 8.\nBy default and similar to ViT [15] we train DeiT models with at resolution\n224 and we ﬁne-tune at resolution 384. We detail how to do this interpolation\nin Section 3. However, in order to measure the inﬂuence of the resolution we\nhave ﬁnetuned DeiT at different resolutions. We report these results in Table 10.\nTraining time. A typical training of 300 epochs takes 37 hours with 2 nodes\nor 53 hours on a single node for the DeiT-B.As a comparison point, a similar\ntraining with a RegNetY-16GF [40] (84M parameters) is 20% slower. DeiT-S and\nDeiT-Ti are trained in less than 3 days on 4 GPU. Then, optionally we ﬁne-tune\nthe model at a larger resolution. This takes 20 hours on a single node (8 GPU)\nto produce a FixDeiT-B model at resolution 384×384, which corresponds to 25\nepochs. Not having to rely on batch-norm allows one to reduce the batch size\nwithout impacting performance, which makes it easier to train larger models.\nNote that, since we use repeated augmentation [4, 25] with 3 repetitions, we\nonly see one third of the images during a single epoch3.\n7 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have introduced DeiT, which are image transformers that\ndo not require very large amount of data to be trained, thanks to improved\n3Formally it means that we have 100 epochs, but each is 3x longer because of the repeated\naugmentations. We prefer to refer to this as 300 epochs in order to have a direct comparison on the\neffective training time with and without repeated augmentation.\n17training and in particular a novel distillation procedure. Convolutional neu-\nral networks have optimized, both in terms of architecture and optimization\nduring almost a decade, including through extensive architecture search that\nis prone to overﬁting, as it is the case for instance for EfﬁcientNets [51]. For\nDeiT we have started the existing data augmentation and regularization strate-\ngies pre-existing for convnets, not introducing any signiﬁcant architectural be-\nyond our novel distillation token. Therefore it is likely that research on data-\naugmentation more adapted or learned for transformers will bring further gains.\nTherefore, considering our results, where image transformers are on par\nwith convnets already, we believe that they will rapidly become a method of\nchoice considering their lower memory footprint for a given accuracy.\nWe provide an open-source implementation of our method.
